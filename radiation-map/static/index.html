        <h2>Real-time Radiation Mapping
        </h2>
        <p>The  <a href="/map">real-time sensor map</a> is updated every five minutes 
            to give a clear picture of the background (mostly gamma) radiation near the 
            Pickering and Darlington nuclear generating stations. There are no concerns currently,
            but in an emergency, you could immediately compare the current levels with the
            previously recorded background counts. A map like this could have allayed fears during the

        <p>
            The collection devices are hosted by volunteers in their homes, reporting via Wi-Fi to the 
            public domain Safecast database. The figure is in counts per minute (CPM), averaged over the previous 60 seconds.
            The exposure is calculated based on Cesium 137 in units of microsieverts (&micro;Sv).
            The current data collection device is the <a href="https://bgeigiezen.safecast.jp/" target="_blank">bGeigieZen</a>.
            If you have the older &quot;workhorse&quot; bGeigieNano, you can upgrade it with the 
            <a href="https://bgeigiezen.safecast.jp/store-2/bgeigiecast-build-for-bgeigienano/" target="_blank">bGeigieCast</a> module.
            Both the Zen and the Cast are available ready-built or as a budget minded do-it-yourself kit.

        <strong>Safecast is an international volunteer driven non-profit organization</strong>
            whose goal is to create useful, accessible, and granular environmental data. 
            All Safecast data is published, free of charge, into the public domain under a CC0 designation.

            After the devastating earthquake and tsunami which struck eastern Japan on March 11, 2011, 
            and the subsequent meltdown of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, accurate and 
            trustworthy radiation information was publicly unavailable. Safecast was formed in response, 
            and quickly began monitoring, collecting, and openly sharing information on environmental 
            radiation &mdash; growing quickly in size, scope, and geographical reach. Before long 
            we began monitoring Air Quality as well. Our mission is to provide citizens worldwide 
            with the tools they need to inform themselves by gathering and sharing accurate 
            environmental data in an open and participatory fashion.<br/>
